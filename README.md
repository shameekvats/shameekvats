# Hi, I'm Shameek Vats! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Materials Engineer by training with a passion for bridging the digital and physical worlds. As a beginner programmer and maker, I love blending creative design with technology to bring innovative ideas to life.

## About Me

Iâ€™m currently exploring several exciting fields:
- **3D Printing & 3D Modeling:** Crafting detailed designs using [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/) and transforming them into physical models with 3D printing.
- **Website Development & Design:** Building modern, responsive websites that combine aesthetics with functionality.
- **Embedded & IoT Projects:** Experimenting with platforms like Raspberry Pi and Microbit to create interactive projects. *(Stay tunedâ€”Iâ€™ll be showcasing these projects on my profile soon!)*
- **Data Analysis & Automation:** Using Python to streamline processes and support my creative projects with data-driven insights.

## What I'm Working On

- **Innovative 3D Designs:** Developing designs in Onshape that are both visually appealing and ready for 3D printing.
- **Modern Web Solutions:** Creating engaging websites that offer intuitive user experiences.
- **Embedded Systems Projects:** Bringing ideas to life with Raspberry Pi and Microbit, exploring the exciting realm of IoT.
- **Integrated Tech Approaches:** Combining automation, data analysis, and creative design to build cohesive, innovative solutions.

## Let's Collaborate!

I'm excited to connect with fellow makers, developers, and designers who are interested in:
- 3D printing and digital fabrication
- 3D modeling using Onshape
- Website development and design
- Embedded projects with Raspberry Pi and Microbit
- Merging automation and data analysis with creative projects
