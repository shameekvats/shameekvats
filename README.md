Hi, I’m Shameek Vats! 👋

I’m a Materials Engineer by training with a passion for bridging the digital and physical worlds. As a beginner programmer and maker, I love blending creative design with technology to bring innovative ideas to life.

About Me

I’m currently exploring several exciting fields:
	•	3D Printing & 3D Modeling: Crafting detailed designs using Onshape and transforming them into physical models with 3D printing.
	•	Website Development & Design: Building modern, responsive websites that combine aesthetics with functionality.
	•	Embedded & IoT Projects: Experimenting with platforms like Raspberry Pi and Microbit to create interactive projects. (Stay tuned—I’ll be showcasing these projects on my profile soon!)
	•	Data Analysis & Automation: Using Python to streamline processes and support my creative projects with data-driven insights.

What I’m Working On
	•	Innovative 3D Designs: Developing designs in Onshape that are both visually appealing and ready for 3D printing.
	•	Modern Web Solutions: Creating engaging websites that offer intuitive user experiences.
	•	Embedded Systems Projects: Bringing ideas to life with Raspberry Pi and Microbit, exploring the exciting realm of IoT.
	•	Integrated Tech Approaches: Combining automation, data analysis, and creative design to build cohesive, innovative solutions.

Let’s Collaborate!

I’m excited to connect with fellow makers, developers, and designers who are interested in:
	•	3D printing and digital fabrication
	•	3D modeling using Onshape
	•	Website development and design
	•	Embedded projects with Raspberry Pi and Microbit
	•	Merging automation and data analysis with creative projects

Feel free to reach out if you have an idea or project in mind—let’s innovate together!
